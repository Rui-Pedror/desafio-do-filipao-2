For this challenge, 
I started by declaring a function with two arguments;
and then I used a vector with six positions;
and defined that it would point to its index when concatenated with the value.
I defined a variable where the value of the wins is stored.
To finish, I used the if and if else decision structure 
and then gave the instructions to print the result on the screen
